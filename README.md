# Landing Page
Only necessary code to be reviewed was uploaded here on Github. This is a from scratch landing page built with CSS + jQuery(for the 2 step form). This is not a live website but just a staging landing page. I uploaded it because it's nice work and also this was done based on a XD prototype, so the UI Design is really nice. 

## Quick Info 
The landing page has a form which saves data on the Database and also sends data via API on a Hubspot account. Here are some info to make the reviewing easier: 

```
1- JS code for the multi-step form is on the /js/custom-functions.js file. 
2- Function to save data on the database is on functions.php file. 
3- Form html code is in /custom-form/form.php file. 
4- Css style for landing page is on style.css and relevant code to landing-page starts after this comment " Coding Challenge CSS ( Here starts the Landing Page css ) ".
The rest is some default CSS styling for the theme. 
5- Since it was just a landing page it was organized as a page-template in Wordpress and code for it is on landing-page.php. 
There you might see some php coding related to ACF which was used to give user possibility to change content later on. 

```



### SETUP 
There's no need for setup because that might have taken some time, since Wordpress dev environments aren't that easy to setup as for other frameworks, so i have included a staging link you can check the landing page live and make it quicker. Here's the link: http://sellics.codentity.net/
